For my final project, I created a Tableau dashboard using a 2022 Major League Baseball hitting statistics dataset from Kaggle, a subject I enjoy following. I applied the key storytelling and informational design principles learned throughout the course to develop multiple sheets that highlight statistics for individual players, teams, and leagues. Using the class template, I organized the data into a cohesive dashboard that communicates insights clearly, while considering ethical and accurate representation of the data. This project demonstrates my ability to create engaging, audience-focused visualizations and translate them into an effective presentation of complex data insights.

ALY6070: Communication and Visualization for Data Analytics

In this course, I learned how to effectively communicate complex quantitative information by understanding the relationship between data and audience. I explored exploratory data visualization, dashboard and scorecard design, and spatial data representation, while also considering the ethical implications of how data is presented. This helped me develop a mindset of creating visualizations that are both accurate and responsible, ensuring stakeholders can trust and interpret the information correctly.

I gained practical skills in designing dashboards that tell a story and using graphic design principles to enhance clarity, accessibility, and aesthetics. I learned how to choose the right type of visualization for the context, reduce clutter, and focus attention on key insights. By practicing these techniques, I can now create and present data visualizations that effectively guide stakeholders toward meaningful conclusions while avoiding bias or misleading representations.

In this project, I explored how effective dashboards communicate research insights by applying Gestalt principles, reducing cognitive load, and focusing audience attention while developing foundational skills in Tableau. For my assignment, I selected a 2022 MLB hitting statistics dataset from Kaggle—choosing a subject I enjoy—to build a multi-sheet Tableau dashboard that highlights key team and player performance metrics. Using the class template, I created visualizations for runs per team, home runs per team, hits per team, and individual RBI leaders, then combined them into a cohesive dashboard that compares trends across leagues and teams. The final dashboard presents RBI leaders across both leagues at the top and team-level hitting metrics below, offering a clear and engaging overview of the dataset while demonstrating effective data storytelling techniques.

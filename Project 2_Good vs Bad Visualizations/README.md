In this module, I explored the importance of ethics in data visualization, learned how misleading design choices can distort information, and practiced recognizing ethical, accurate visual representations. Using an ice cream sales dataset, I created both a poor visualization and an improved version to highlight how cluttered layouts, inappropriate chart types, and unclear labeling can mislead or confuse viewers. My bad visualization demonstrated how clustered columns, repeated month labels, and a single overwhelming color scheme can obscure insights, while my revised horizontal bar chart offered a cleaner, more intuitive presentation of daily sales by month, making the data easier to interpret and ethically communicated. Additionally, this module introduced the fundamentals of Tableau and its basic functions, reinforcing how thoughtful tool selection and design principles are essential for creating honest and effective visualizations.

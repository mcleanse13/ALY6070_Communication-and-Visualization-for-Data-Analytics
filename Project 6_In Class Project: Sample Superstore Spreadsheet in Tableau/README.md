This project represents the final in-class Tableau assignment for the course, where I applied the full set of data storytelling, visualization, and dashboard-design concepts covered throughout the module. Working with the Sample Superstore Excel dataset—which includes fields such as order details, customer information, product categories, sales, discounts, and profit—I created an interactive dashboard that communicates key insights clearly and ethically for a defined audience. This final project demonstrates my ability to evaluate data context, select appropriate visualizations, and organize information into a coherent narrative that supports decision-making. It also reflects the course learning objectives by showcasing strong visual storytelling elements, effective use of Tableau’s design tools, and the ability to translate dashboard insights into a clear presentation.

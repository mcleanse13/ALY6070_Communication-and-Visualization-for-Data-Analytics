In this project, I applied design thinking and data storytelling principles to analyze a 2022 Major League Baseball dataset using Tableau calculated fields. I created two key calculations: the first divided total hits by total at-bats for each team to calculate batting averages, which I visualized in a heat map from best to worst performing teams. The second calculation determined the average games played per player by dividing total games by team roster size, and I also calculated the average age per team. These metrics were displayed in bar charts for National League teams, allowing me to explore relationships between team performance, player activity, and age. This project reinforced the importance of choosing appropriate visuals, reducing cognitive load, and telling a clear story with data to make insights accessible and engaging for the audience.
